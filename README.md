# Description

This web application provides a list of items within a variety of categories and integrate third party user registration and authentication.
This is a RESTful web application created with Python 3 and the Python micro-framework Flask.
The app uses SQLite database that contains a catalog of items and associated information.
The database is created by running database_setup.py and initial data is populated by running itemsforcatalog.py
The main code is located in application.py
This app uses google for third party authentication.

## Usage
**Steps to run the APP:**


* Clone the catalog repo (https://github.com/divyasuneeth/CatalogAPI)
* Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
* Launch the Vagrant VM using **vagrant up** command.
* Once it is up and running, type **vagrant ssh**. This will log your terminal into the virtual machine, and you'll get a Linux shell prompt. When you want to log out, type **exit** at the shell prompt.  To turn the virtual machine off (without deleting anything), type **vagrant halt**. If you do this, you'll need to run **vagrant up** again before you can log into it.
* navigate to the catalog folder on your vagrant machine
  * by changing to /vagrant directory by typing **cd /vagrant**. This will take you to the shared folder between your virtual machine and host machine.
  * Type **ls** to ensure that you are inside the directory that contains application.py, database_setup.py, and two directories named 'templates' and 'static'
* Now type **python database_setup.py** to initialize the database.
* Type **python itemsforcatalog.py** to populate the database with category and items. (Optional)
* type **python application.py** to run the Flask web server. In your browser visit **http://localhost:8000** to view the Catalog app.
